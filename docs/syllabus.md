<h3 style="text-align: center; margin: 0;">University of San Diego | Spring 2025: 3 Units</h3>

## COURSE OVERVIEW

### Course Description
In today’s data-driven world, organizations often find themselves rich in data but lacking actionable insights. This course explores the field of data mining, which focuses on extracting meaningful insights from data to support quantitative decision-making. You will get a comprehensive introduction to key data mining concepts and techniques, with an emphasis on their practical application. While the technical details of methodologies will be covered as needed, the primary focus will be on how to effectively use these techniques in real-world scenarios using Python, one of the most popular tools for data analysis and mining. By the end of the course, you will not only develop an appreciation for the vast opportunities within the field of business analytics but also acquire the skills and knowledge needed to leverage these opportunities effectively.

Assignment and Exam grades are released typically a week after the submission date. It is your responsibility to check your grade and reach out if you believe there is a problem. Final Grades are not rounded up.

### Conceptual Homework
There are eight (8) conceptual homework assignments that focus on understanding key concepts and solving problems step-by-step by hand, rather than relying on programmatic solutions. While you are allowed to use Python/AI tools to support your learning during homework, it is essential to ensure you fully understand the reasoning and process behind the solutions. AI will **not** be permitted during exams, so developing your ability to work through problems independently is critical for success. 

!!! tip
    Use these assignments as an opportunity to practice and solidify your understanding, so you’re well-prepared for exam-style questions.

### Programming Assignments
There are four (4) homework assignments consisting of problem-solving and Python based programming assignments. The purpose is to provide students with the opportunity to apply and practice the concepts and skills learned in the lectures and demos. Homeworks may be difficult and require you to demonstrate a deeper understanding of the material.

### Case Study and Group Project
There is one (1) case study and group project that you will be able to collaborate with 1 other classmate. For the case study, you will choose from a list of the cases in the textbook and apply the relevant concepts that we have learned. For the group project, you will pick your own dataset and identify the problem statement and prepare your own analysis and presentation of your findings at the end of the semester.

### Exams
Both exams are open-note and completed by yourself with no collaboration/communication with any other students. You will **not** be able to use a computer during exams. No late exams are permitted, except for extenuating circumstances. Please reach out as early as possible if you know something will prevent you from attending class on exam dates.     

### Class Attendance
The goal is to make lectures worth your while to attend. Some class dates may only consist of a lecture but the vast majority of classes will involve hands-on practice with Python and Jupyter Notebooks. Regular attendance is very important to your success in this course. 

### Late Submission Policy
There is a 24-hour grace period for all homework and programming assignments with **NO** late penalty. Assignment submissions will **NOT** be accepted after the grace period. This policy is intended to be a safety net in case you experience any difficulties submitting your assignment on time. Do not view the grace period as the true due date for the assignment. If you miss an assignment due date, it is likely that you are not managing your time effectively and will need to adjust your planning and study habits. Please note that any excuse for not submitting assignments on time will not be accepted **AFTER** the 24-hour grace period. If you have extenuating circumstances, you must contact the professor **BEFORE** the assignment due date.

### Regrade Policy
The intent of the regrade policy is protect students from serious issues in grading. Email the professor within **72 hours** and provide evidence for why your answer is correct and merits a regrade (i.e. a specific reference to something said in a lecture, the readings, or office hours). Make sure you confer with your team first on any group completed project and submit one regrade request after your team comes to a consensus.
